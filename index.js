/*
  We start by creating an empty Set called showNumbers.
  This Set will help us keep track of numbers we've already looked at as we go through the array.
  We loop through each number (num) in the array
  For each number, we calculate the complement, which is the number that would complete the pair to reach the target sum.
  Example: If target is 12 and num is 5, then complement would be 7, because 5 + 7 = 10.
